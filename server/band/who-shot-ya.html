		<h3>The Notorious B.I.G. â€“ Who Shot Ya?</h3>
			<p>
				As we proceed to give you what you need<br >

				[Verse 1]<br ><br >
				Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete<br >
				Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets<br >
				It's on nigga: fuck all that bickering beef<br >
				I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek<br >
				Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet<br >
				Thundering, shaking the concrete<br >
				Then the shit stop when I foil the plot<br >
				Neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots<br >
				Saw me in the drop, 3 and a quarter<br >
				Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter<br >
				Old school new school need to learn though<br >
				I "Burn, baby, burn" like Disco Inferno<br >
				Burn slow like blunts with yayo<br >
				Peel more skins than Idaho potato<br >
				Niggas know: the lyrical molesting is taking place<br >
				Fucking with B.I.G. it ain't safe<br >
				I make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses<br >
				Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers<br >
				Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools<br >
				Niggas mad because I know that Cash Rules<br >
				Everything Around Me, 2 Glock 9's<br >
				Any motherfucker whispering about mines<br >
				And I'm Crooklyn's finest<br >
				You rewind this, Bad Boy's behind this<br ><br >

				[Verse 2]<br ><br >
				I seen the light excite all the freaks<br >
				Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps<br >
				Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back<br >
				Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?<br >
				I switches all that, cocksucker G's up<br >
				One false move, get Swiss cheesed up<br >
				Clip to Tec, respect I demand it<br >
				Slip and break the, 11th Commandment<br >
				Thou shalt not fuck with raw C-Poppa<br >
				Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya<br >
				I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don<br >
				Pussy when I want Rolex on the arm<br >
				You'll die slow but calm<br >
				Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake<br >
				So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga<br >
				Brave nigga, turned front page nigga<br >
				Puff Daddy flips daily<br >
				I smoke the blunts he sips on the Bailey's<br >
				On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings<br >
				Hammer cock, in the fire position and<br >

				[Outro]<br ><br >
				Come here, come here, (It ain't gotta be like that Big)<br >
				Open your fucking mouth, open your, didn't I tell you<br >
				Don't fuck with me? (Come on man)<br >
				Huh? Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me? (Come on man)<br >
				Look at you now, huh? (Come on man)<br >
				Can't talk with a gun in your mouth huh?<br >
				Bitch-ass nigga, what?.. Who shot ya?<br >
